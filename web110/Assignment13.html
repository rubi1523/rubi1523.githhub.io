  <h1>Final Project Overview</h1>

  <p>
   My final project aims to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned about social media and its impact on communication, creativity, and community-building. This project will highlight how platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X allow users to connect with others on both a personal and global scale. The scope of the projects includes an overview of how content is created and shared, the role of engagement strategies, and the positive and negative effects of social media. It will also explore branding, audience interaction, misinformation, and mental health. Reflecting on these areas, I hope to demonstrate a deeper understanding of how social media influences our digital world.
