        In Web 101, I learned various concepts that have helped me understand how the internet works and how we interact daily. I explored the basics of coding, especially how HTML is used to build and structure web pages. I also learned how search engines operate, including how they can rank pages to help people find information faster. The course has covered the importance of data and how it’s gathered, stored, and analyzed to improve websites and user experience. In addition, I gained insight into the role of social media and digital communication in shaping how we connect, share ideas, and build communities online. Overall, Web 101 has taught me a strong introduction to the technologies and platforms that drive today’s web.
