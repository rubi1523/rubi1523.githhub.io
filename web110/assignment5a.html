    <p>Reading the article Social Networking, I understood what social networking is and how it is used. Social networking connects individuals and organizations through platforms like Facebook and Twitter and mobile apps like WhatsApp. These services allow people to share content such as text, photos, and videos. Popular platforms cater to various purposes, including online marketing, job networking, and communication. Social network keeps us updated with the latest news, discover new talent, and build professional connections. With these platforms, I can use them for my own personal and professional growth, as well as being informed about trends, jobs, and events in my field.
