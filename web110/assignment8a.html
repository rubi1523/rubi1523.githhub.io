        <p>Reading Introduction to HTML, I learned what HTML is.  It is a standard language for creating web pages. It structures web content using elements that define headings, paragraphs, links, and other components. The browser interprets HTML to display web pages correctly, ignoring the tags. A basic HTML document consists of essential elements like  <html>, <head>, and <body>. HTML has evolved since its creation in 1991, with versions improving functionality. Learning HTML can be useful if I ever want to build a website, edit online content, or understand web development. It provides a foundation for digital literacy and enhances my ability to be able to navigate the web.Reading about HTML, I understood that HTML is a formatting language used to structure web pages by organizing text, images, and multimedia. The concepts I learned were HTML structure, HTML elements, and HTML Versions. With HTML versions being innovated by Tim Berners-Lee to modern HTML 5. HTML tags define how concepts appear on web pages, with most tags requiring both opening and closing elements. Understanding basic tags, formatting tabs, tables, lists, frames, and forms allows me to be able to create a structured web page. Being able to apply these concepts I can design, format, and enhance webpages, forming a strong foundation for web development.
