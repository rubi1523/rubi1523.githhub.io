        <p>Reading Introduction to HTML, I learned what HTML is.  It is a standard language for creating web pages. It structures web content using elements that define headings, paragraphs, links, and other components. The browser interprets HTML to display web pages correctly, ignoring the tags. A basic HTML document consists of essential elements like  <html>, <head>, and <body>. HTML has evolved since its creation in 1991, with versions improving functionality. Learning HTML can be useful if I ever want to build a website, edit online content, or understand web development. It provides a foundation for digital literacy and enhances my ability to be able to navigate the web.
