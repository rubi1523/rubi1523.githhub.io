    <h1>Session 9 Assignment</h1>
    <p>Reading the CSS notes, I was able to understand what a cascading style sheet is. Cascading style sheet defines how web pages will look by applying style in a structured order, known as cascade. Styles can be added using inline, external, or internal styles, with external stylesheets being organized. I learned how to create an external stylesheet, which helps keep web design clean and efficient and learned about attributes such as herf for links. Knowing herf I can create clickable links that connect web pages, files, or external resources. This knowledge allows me to customize personal websites, design outline profiles, and improve blog layouts. It can also be useful in building websites for small businesses, making it a valuable skill for future opportunities.
