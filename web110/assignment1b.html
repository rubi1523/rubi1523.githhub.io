    <p> In completing the lesson from internet technologies, I learned about the technical structure of the Internet, its evolution, and its various applications. Mainly I explored how the Internet functions through the TCP/IP protocol, which assigns unique IP addresses to every device, and how DNS servers convert domain names into these IP addresses for easy location. Additionally, the lesson highlighted the Internet’s evolution from ARPANET, developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, to the expansive, global system it is today. This knowledge is particularly useful in my current or future environment, whether it’s for work, education, or personal use. Understanding DNS and IP addressing can aid in troubleshooting network issues or optimizing the use of Internet services.</p>
