    <p>Reading Internet Reference Models, I learned what they are and what they do. The International Organization for Standardization developed the OSI Model, standardizing communication globally across diverse network devices. It divides network function into seven physical layers, data link, network, transport, session, presentation, and application. Each layer handles specific tasks, such as managing physical connections, routing signals, and ensuring data integrity. Understanding the OSI model is helpful if I were to work with technology or networking. It can assist in troubleshooting network issues, optimizing devices, and communication, and improving problem-solving skills, which can add to the daily use of digital devices. 

The article Internet Protocols explains how the entire system works. Transmission Control Protocol is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol that ensures end-to-end packet delivery. It is a crucial part of the OSI modelâ€™s, Transport layer, offering services like stream data transfer, efficient flow control, and full-duplex operation. TCP guarantees data reliability by sequencing and acknowledging bytes, and it retransmits unacknowledged data. It provides a connection-oriented service by establishing communication between two processes, ensuring reliable transmission. TCP can help troubleshoot network issues, optimize internet connection reliability, and ensure data integrity for activities like file transfer or web browsing. Knowing how TCP works can help me any many ways when it comes to the internet or technology.
