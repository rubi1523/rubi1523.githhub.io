    <p>The activity I did was The W3C Markup Value. The W3C Markup Value is a tool that checks HTML and XHTML documents for errors to ensure they meet web standards. By using this validator, I learned how to identify and fix syntax errors in my codes, improving accessibility, compatibility, and overall website performance. This activity taught me the importance of clean, structured markup and how validation helps prevent browser inconsistency. Moving forward, I can use this tool to debug codes effectively, maintain best practices in web development, and ensure that my website adheres to W3C standards for better usability and search engine optimization. 

The activity I did was the Wave Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool. This is a tool that helps evaluate the accessibility of websites by identifying potential issues that may affect users with disabilities. By using this tool, I learned how to assess a web pageâ€™s accessibility, including issues related to color contrast, missing alternative text for images, and improper heading structure. Wave provides visual feedback, highlighting areas that need improvement, and offers suggestions to enhance accessibility. I can use this tool in the future to ensure that my websites are inclusive and usable for all users, including people who have disabilities.
