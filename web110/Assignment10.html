  <h1>Assignment 10 - HTML Structure</h1>
    <p>In this assignment, I learned about various graphics and design aspects, focusing on the distinction between raster and vector images. Raster images are pixel-based, while vector images are. Raster images are pixel-based, while vector images use a mathematical path, making them scalable without losing quality. I also explored two types of compression: lossy compression, which reduces file size by discarding some data, and lossless compression, which retains all original data, and lossless compression, which retains all original data. Additionally, I gained insight into HTML concepts such as the <imgage> tag for embedding images, the <audio> tag for sound files, and the <video> tag for multimedia content. I have greatly expanded my understanding of integrating visual and multimedia elements into web pages. I can now confidently use different image types, apply appropriate compression methods, and utilize HTML tags to enhance the interactivity and visual appeal of a webpage. These skills will allow me to create more engaging, user-friendly content by effectively incorporating images, sound, and video into digital projects.
