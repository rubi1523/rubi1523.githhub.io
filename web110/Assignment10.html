  <h1>Assignment 10 - HTML Structure</h1>
    <p>In this assignment, I learned about graphics and design, including the difference between raster and vector images. Raster images are pixel-based, while vector images use mathematical paths for scalability. I also learned about two types of compression: lossy, which removes some data to reduce file size, and lossless, which preserves all original data. Additionally, I explored HTML concepts such as the <image> tag for images, <audio> for sound files, and <video> for multimedia content. Understanding these elements helps me enhance and create visually appealing and interactive web pages by properly integrating images, audio, and videos, making content more engaging and interactive for users.
