    <p>Reading Internet Safety I understood how to keep myself safe online. The internet is a place where there are many opportunities for malware, spam, and phishing. To stay safe, adopt a cautious mindset as you would in a public place. One important step is creating a strong password to protect your online accounts. A secure password should be long, unique, and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information or common words. Random passwords are stronger, and password managers can help securely store them. By knowing these guidelines I can apply them to safeguard my personal information and navigate the internet safely.
