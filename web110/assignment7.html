    <p>Reading Internet Safety I understood how to keep myself safe online. The internet is a place where there are many opportunities for malware, spam, and phishing. To stay safe, adopt a cautious mindset as you would in a public place. One important step is creating a strong password to protect your online accounts. A secure password should be long, unique, and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information or common words. Random passwords are stronger, and password managers can help securely store them. By knowing these guidelines I can apply them to safeguard my personal information and navigate the internet safely. In the article Internet Security, I learned about the different security protocols such as ISPec and SSL, which help protect data by securing communications over the internet. IPSec provides security at the network level, while SSL secures communication at the transport layer, ensuring privacy, integrity, and authentication. It highlights common threats like malware, phishing, and ransomware, particularly email phishing, where criminals impersonate legitimate companies to steal sensitive information. I can use this to make sure I am cautious when browsing online, verify the authenticity of emails, and regularly update software to protect against malware.
