    <p>Reading the article Internet Services, I understood what Internet services are. The various Internet services allow us to access, communicate, and retrieve information online. Key categories include Communication Services such as email, VolP, and instant messaging, which facilitate communication, and information retrieval services such as FTP and Archie, which help find and transfer data; web services enable application interaction, while the World Wide Web provides access to documents across the internet, The article also covers video conferencing, which allows real-time audio and video communication between locations. I can apply these services by utilizing email for efficient communication, FTP for file sharing, and video conferencing for remote meetings, improving personal and professional productivity.

While reading the article What is Skype on Skype, I learned what Skype is and how to use it. Skype is a free program that enables users to make voice and video calls over the internet using VoLp technology. It allows personal communication through one-on-one or group calls, messaging, and even video chats on computers or mobile devices. While most features on Skpye are free, calling landlines or cell phones incur a small fee. Alternatives to Skype are Facebook video calling, Google Hangouts, Apple Facetime, and many others. I can use Skype to stay connected with family and friends, conduct virtual meetings, and save money by avoiding traditional call fees when communicating abroad.
