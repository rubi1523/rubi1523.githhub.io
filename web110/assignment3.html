    <p>Reading the article Computer- Search Engines, I was able to understand that search-engines are a web based tool that helps find information on the internet allowing them to input queries or keyboards. The search engine then returns relevant results from the index which contain collections of data like web pages, likes, videos and other online content. Popular search engines include Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuck Go and Ask.com. This knowledge is particularly useful in my current or future environment, whether it’s for personal use or work data. Being able to understand how a search engine analogy works can help organize your information. Whether it’s managing projects or handling documents, creating a personal index can allow you to retrieve what you need when you need it.

While reading all about online search on Search Better, the ability to search online is a crucial digital literacy skill. Search engines like Google help users quickly find relevant information by using simple keywords. You can start by searching on the homepage or use the browse address bar. If you want a specific search you can go ahead and advance the settings. Personalize your google by setting your location, making your homepage, or creating a google account. Learning how to use these techniques can save time and help you find accurate and detailed information, making you more efficient and resourceful in everyday tasks.
