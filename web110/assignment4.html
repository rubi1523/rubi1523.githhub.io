    <p>Reading the article on Email Etiquette and safety on email basics, I was able to learn how to write a proper email as well and how I can protect myself from malware and phishing. I discovered how to create effective emails with clear subject lines, proper greetings, and concise messaging. Additionally, I gained insights on email safety, including how I can spot phishing scams as well as avoid malicious attachments, and protect personal information. By following practice like using professional language and being cautious with attachments, I can improve my email communication both personally and in the workplace. This will help me maintain professionalism and avoid common email mistakes while ensuring my digital security when using email for various purposes. The article Email Overview taught me the components of an email and some pros and cons of using email. An email includes key components like the header, greeting, text, and signature. Email has many advantages, such as being fast and cost-effective. It allows instant communication and is a relatively inexpensive way to stay connected with others, both personally and professionally. However, there are also some downsides to email, one being a major risk of spam where unsolicited and sometimes harmful emails can flood your inbox. Despite these, email remains a valuable tool for managing communication quickly and conveniently.
