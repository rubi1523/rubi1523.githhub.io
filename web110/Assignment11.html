    <h1>Northwind Database Exercise Answers</h1>
    <p>
In this activity, I explored the Northwind database, I learned how a well-structured database can organize various business-related data, such as customers, orders, and products. It also uses SQL queries to manage relationships and retrieve meaningful insight. By using tables and relationships, data can be efficiently retrieved and analyzed. This knowledge can be applied to my life by helping me understand how businesses track and manage information, which is useful for roles involving customer service, marketing, or inventory management. I can apply these concepts to manage data better in personal projects or a future career, especially in social media management and customer relations.
